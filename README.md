# Customer-lifetime-value-prediction
For an Auto Insurance company, we need to predict the conditions affecting customer lifetime value(CLV). CLV is the total revenue the client will derive from their entire relationship with a customer. Here we can see that as the name suggests we need to predict the customer lifetime value for each customer so as to make sure how much benefit each customer can repay to the company in exchange of the benefits he or she receives. Approach: We do a regression model to find out how and why the clv gets affected and how to tackle clv so that the company can benefit and also cluster the train dataset to understand behaviour of each segment. We start so by taking clv as the dependent variable and the whole model based on this variable.
